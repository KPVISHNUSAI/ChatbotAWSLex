# **Building Banking Chatbot using Amazon Lex**  

Welcome to the **Banking Chatbot** project! This chatbot is designed to enhance the customer experience by providing real-time assistance for banking-related queries. Built with **Amazon Lex**, this intelligent conversational interface aims to automate a variety of financial tasks, ensuring customers get prompt, secure, and accurate responses to their inquiries.  

Amazon Lex is a fully managed service from AWS that enables developers to build conversational interfaces (chatbots and voice assistants) powered by **natural language understanding (NLU)** and **automatic speech recognition (ASR)**.

### **Step 2: Creating Your First Intent**  
1. After the bot is created, youâ€™ll be on the **Intent: NewIntent** page.  
2. **Change the Intent Name**:  
   - Under **Intent details**, enter **WelcomeIntent** as the new name.  
3. **Description**:  
   - Add: **Welcoming a user when they say hello**.  
4. **Sample Utterances**:  
   - Scroll down to the **Sample utterances** panel.  
   - Click the **Plain Text** button.  
   - Add these utterances:  
     - Hi  
     - Hello  
     - I need help  
     - Can you help me?  
5. **Preview Utterances**:  
   - Switch back to the **Preview button** to see how these utterances appear in chat.  
6. **Closing Response**:  
   - Scroll down to **Closing response** and expand the speech bubble under **Response sent to the user after the intent is fulfilled**.  
   - In the **Message field**, enter:  
     ```  
     Hi! I'm BB, the Banking Bot. How can I help you today?  
     ```  
7. **Save the Intent**:  
   - Click **Save intent**.  
8. **Build the Bot**:  
   - Click **Build** at the top of the page.  
   - (This process takes about 30 seconds â€“ time for a quick stretch! ðŸ˜Š)  
9. **Test Your Bot**:  
   - After building, click **Test** to interact with the bot using your sample utterances.  
   - Try different phrases:  
     - Hi  
     - Hello  
     - I need help  
     - Can you help me?  

10. **Explore Other Inputs**:  
    - Since weâ€™ve set the confidence threshold to **0.40**, Lex might understand related phrases too! Try these:  
      - Help me  
      - Hiya  
      - How are you?  
      - Good morning  

ðŸ’¡ **Note:**  
- **First three** inputs work fine, as Lexâ€™s **ML engine** can match similar intents.  
- **Last two** may not work and trigger a **FallbackIntent**, meaning Lex doesnâ€™t recognize them yet (weâ€™ll explore this in the next step).

11. **Test Voice Interaction**:  
    - Click the **microphone icon** on the left of the chatbox.  
    - Speak: "Hello" and click the tick icon to submit.  
    - Now, try another greeting or way of saying hello!  

ðŸ’¡ **Voice Tips:**  
- The bot uses the **English (US) dialect**, so it may not perfectly transcribe other English accents.  
- Amazon Lex supports multiple **English dialects** for better accuracy.
